## Week 2
1. Spreng (2009) Common neural basis of autobiographical memory... ToM, and the default mode: a quantitative meta-analysis
  - ALE method used to analyze coactivated regions for different tasks.
  - Michael Corballis - we wander mentally not only in time but also in the minds of others.
  - Default mode network - Yeo et al 16, 17 states.

2. Koster-Hale & Saxe (2013) Theory of Mind: a neural prediction problem
  - Reframing theory of mind as a neural prediction problem - predictive coding framework.
  - Theory of mind regions: STS, TPJ, PC, and MPFC have been implicated with TOM since Frith & Frith (2000)
    - general predictions -> social predictions.
      - SHORTER timescale
      - stable sensory inputs
        - bodily, facial movements (STS)
      - sequences of sensory inputs
        - gaze direction (STS)
      - internal causal models
        - agent goal contingent actions (STS)
        - self consistent actions, social norms (TPJ)
        - preferences, traits, reputation (MPFC)
          - TPJ and MPFC could be more semantic ToM like he is a nice guy compared to action based ToM inferring when you reach for a cup
      - LONGER timescale.
    - Marc Johnson - Conspec & Conlearn face perception.
    - First impression as spontaneous ToM
      - novel (probably no spontaneous ToM but more subcortical activations) vs familiar faces (spontaneous TOM activation)
  - Predictive coding framework: neural responses contain information not just
  about the input/perceived stimulus but also the difference between the experienced
  and the expected value. key idea is that neural activity is modulated by predictability
  - Sources of predictions: social environment provides contexts that allow predictions.
    What associations are you trying to predict?
  - Predicting goal-directed action: STS. body movements allow goal directed action predictions.
  - Predicting beliefs and desires: TPJ.
  - Predicting preferences and personalities: MPFC, PC

3. Richardson (2018) Development of the social brain from age 3 to 12 years
  - 3-12 year olds, large sample n=122, n=33 adults as a reference group.
  - 1. TOM and pain networks are distinct in connectivity while watching movie by age 3.
  - 2. functional specialization increases through age.
  - 3. functional maturity of each network is related to increasingly anti-correlated
  responses between the networks.
  - Implication: ToM development is a gradual process not a discontinuous process.
  - Reverse correlation: replication of Hasson's face finding.

4. Heyes (2014) The cultural evolution of mind reading
  - ToM ability develops very early
  - Both mind reading and print reading are forms of sign reading
    - reading signs from face or body vs reading squiggles on paper
  -

5. Replication failure of implicit ToM: [Kulke, L., von Duhn, B., Schneider, D., & Rakoczy, H. (2018). Is implicit theory of mind a real and robust phenomenon? Results from a systematic replication study. Psychological science, 0956797617747090.](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0956797617747090)
  - Only 1 of 4 paradigms successfully replicated.
  - Once confounds were removed, that paradigm also did not replicate.
  - Confound:   - ```First, in the
  original videos in the two familiarization trials, the
  object was always placed on the same side. That side
  was later also the correct (i.e., belief-congruent) side
  in the test trial (see Fig. 4). Second, in the original
  stimulus videos, the actress always turned toward the
  belief-congruent location at the end of the trial, right
  before the beginning of the time window in which
  anticipatory looking was measured. Both facts may cue
  participantsâ€™ looking behavior toward the beliefcongruent
  location.  ```

[Brothers,L. (1990). The social brain: A project for integrating primate behavior and neurophysiology in a new domain. Concepts in Neuroscience, 1, 27-51.](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=nQk5Pv9kf-YC&oi=fnd&pg=PA367&dq=The+social+brain:+A+project+for+integrating+primate+behavior+and+neurophysiology+in+a+new+domain&ots=ry9Y3HCdex&sig=oinllCEv6ao3wYBwaF-b6SBmkeM#v=twopage&q&f=true)
- social cognition: processing information for accurate perception of disposition & intentions of other individuals.
- argues that social cognition is a special domain. evolution from olfaction to vision for social communication accompanied increased complexity in social structure; communication of internal state through face and expressions.
- social knowledge is unique than other knowledge. social knowledge-related impairments in autistic children
- neurological syndromes that impair social perception
  - Patient EVR: OFC lesion, lost ability to respond appropriately in social situations.
  - Capgras syndrome: thinking the person is a imposter
  - paranoid psychoses: distorted thoughts of other's intentions
- Humans can experience many diverse affects.
  - purple is not a combination of feeling red and blue
  - richness of complex emotions
    - people often describe emotion "as if I were in such-such situation"
- Amygdaloid simulations - stimulate emotional memories.

Q. Is there a study where you compare brain representation of emotions from situation described vs label vs facial emotion?


Dunbar RIM (1998). The social brain hypothesis.  Evolutionary Anthropology, 6,  178-190.


Dunbar RIM, Schultz S. (2007) Evolution in the social brain. Science, 317, 1344-1347.
- Original idea Byrne and Whiten : Machiavellian Intelligence hypothesis  but  adopted Social Brain Hypothesis because less contentious.
